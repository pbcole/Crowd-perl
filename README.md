Crowd-perl
==========

Perl module for accessing Atlassian Crowd application.

Very much a work in progress.  Motivated by starting to use Atlassian products at work and
thinking "Wouldn't it be great to be able to use Crowd to authenticate perl applications, 
and not finding an existing module to do it.

Very much in a state of flux.  May change from time to time until I settle on something that
works for me and anyone else who picks this up.
